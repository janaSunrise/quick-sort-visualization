```

Here are the controls!

- `Space` key press to start running the algorithm, and run it for the pre-added list.
- `R` Key press to generate a random array again, and sort it using the algorithm.

**Color Coding Syntax:**
        
- `Turquoise`: Pivot bar
- `Green`: Sorted bar
- `White`: Unsorted bar

You can modify the default list, by changing the value of the variable `ARRAY` in `__init__.py`
And use the following controls as written above to visualize it's sorting.
